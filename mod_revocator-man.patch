+.SH "NAME"
+crlhelper \- Helper program used to store-and-forward CRLs
+
+.SH "SYNOPSIS"
+crlhelper <semid> <parentpid> <directory> [prefix]
+
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+A helper program used by the Apache \fBhttpd\fP mod_revocator plug-in to
+store-and-forward CRLs from upstream to the various Apache processes in
+the preform MPM. This saves each process from having to fetch the CRL itself.
+This is not expected to be run by end-users.
+.PP
+The mod_revocator plug-in requires the mod_nss plug-in to also be registered
+with this Apache \fBhttpd\fP process.
+.PP
+Whenever an Apache \fBhttpd\fP process configured to use the mod_revocator
+plug-in is started, this program will be automatically invoked via reference
+to the mod_revocator configuration file stored under
+\fB/etc/httpd/conf.d/revocator.conf\fP which contains the following default
+entry:
+.IP
+#   CRL Helper:
+.br
+#   This helper program does the actual CRL retrieval
+.br
+#
+.br
+#   NOTE:  Located at '/usr/bin/crlhelper' prior
+.br
+#          to 'mod_revocator-1.0.3-16'.
+.br

+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B <semid>
+The semaphore which corresponds to the mod_revocator plug-in registered with the Apache \fBhttpd\fP process during startup.
+.TP
+.B <parentpid>
+The primary parent pid of the Apache \fBhttpd\fP process into which both the mod_nss and mod_revocator plug-ins have been loaded.
+.TP
+.B <directory>
+Since the mod_revocator plug-in depends upon the mod_nss plug-in being configured, this option specifies the destination directory of the NSS databases that will be associated with this executable specified by the following entry in the mod_nss plug-in's \fB/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf\fP configuration file:
+.IP
+.TS
+tab(;);

+;#   Server Certificate Database:
+;#   The NSS security database directory that holds the
+;#   certificates and keys. The database consists
+;#   of 3 files: cert8.db, key3.db and secmod.db.
+;#   Provide the directory that these files exist.
+;NSSCertificateDatabase /etc/httpd/alias
+.TE
+.TP
+.B [prefix]
+Optional prefix to attach prior to the names of the NSS certificate and key databases contained in the directory referenced by the previous argument and specified by the following entry in mod_nss plug-in's \fB/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf\fP configuration file (must be uncommented in order to be utilized):

+A tool supplied with the Apache \fBhttpd\fP mod_revocator plug-in used to demonstrate how CRLs can be fetched using LDAP/LDAPS without the use of any direct LDAP/LDAPS URLs.
